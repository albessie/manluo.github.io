## ACADEMIC RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### Item name: *SMT stencil Image Registration Based on Machine Vision*          2016.10-2019.03
#### *Background:*
+ SMT(surface mount technology) is an assembly technique that directly solders electronic components to a specified position on the PCB  board. As the SMT template, stencil is made by laser cutting which leads to defects in it. Stencil image registration is a prerequisite for identifying those defects. Stencil images with the high resolution consist of intensive graphics distributed regularly, which made traditional registration methods invalid.

**My work:**
+ Proposed an novel image registration algorithm based on the coordinate distribution. I regarded the gravity center points of all    graphics in the stencil as feature points, and clustered “similar” points as a feature group. The feature information about the groups is unique, differing from that of others. Through experiments, registration deviations are within ±3 pixels(around 48μm).

+ Proposed a more efficient registration method based on two-node tree for stencil image with thousands of data. The two-node tree has only two nodes in a layer, which functions as selecting feature points with less time-consuming. Those non-corresponding feature points can be filtered out by simplified RANSAC. Experimental results showed not only its robustness and high-tolerant rate, but also its wide application for all types of stencil images.The performance was much better than the above one.

### Item name: *Precise Measurement of Microwave Resonator Based on Photoelectric System*             2017.10-2018.08
#### *Background:*
+ Wuhan Fingu Automation Company commissioned the height and size measurement item for the key parameters of their product: Microwave Resonator. Accurate positioning and scanning of the product is the first and key part of the entire project.

**My work:**
+ Designed the entire photoelectric imaging system for measurement. Carried out a great number of experiments on the camera and light source equipment to find out the best parameters for imaging.
+ Designed a complete real-time positioning and scanning algorithm. It was approved by Party A in the mid-term stage.
+ Due to request for the high precision of the scanning location, I improved the original algorithm and it was put into practical use.
+ Provided technical support during the use of Party A and modified the algorithm for problems found in the use of Party A. Sent regular problem analysis reports to the company, communicated in time and proposed solutions.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Brain Science and Medical Cross-Joint Laboratory, China Electrics Science Research Institute             2019.09-Now
+ Used the deep learning model YOLOv3 to automatically recognize the number of the medicine tablets and capsules on individuals’ palms in natural scenes.

+ Analyzed the connection between the individuals’ daily levels of stress and daily data collected by their smartphone sensors. Tried to figure out whether that information could be behavioral marker for one’s mental health.
